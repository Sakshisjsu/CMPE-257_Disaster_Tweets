Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

Twitter is one of the most important communication channels.
We acquire much of our daily news on Twitter these days. 
Problem: 
How can we know if we are receiving accurate information? 
What if we wish to distinguish between real-life circumstances and irrelevant data?
Solution:
We use Natural language Processing to  find relevant and actionable information on Social Media.
